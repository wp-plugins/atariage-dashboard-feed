AtariAge Dashboard Feed

== Description ==

Version 1.0 requires Wordpress 2.7 but we have included a backup stylesheet for users who haven't made the switch yet. Please see the installation instructions for reverting to older Wordpress versions.

Based on the excellent plugin "Techorati Incoming Links" by Alberto Varela, this plugin has been modified to display the AtariAge RSS ( Really Simple Syndication ) Feed directly on your WordPress Dashboard. 

We have a great respect for AtariAge, and everything Atari for that matter, but there isn't enough time during the busy work week to check in with the site as we would like. To reconcile this issue we took a look at the increasing amount of web design involving WordPress and thought it was only logical to add the AtariAge RSS feed to our development sites. We took Alberto Varela's plugin, modified it, and added a little extra flair such as: the article's publication date, full content, and a fancy AtariAge icon to finalize the look.
