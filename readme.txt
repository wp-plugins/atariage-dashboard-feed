AtariAge Dashboard Feed

== Description ==

Based on the excellent plugin "Techorati Incoming Links" by Alberto Varela, this plugin has been modified to display the AtariAge RSS Feed directly on your WordPress Dashboard. Call me lazy, but I don't have as much time to check AtariAge as I would like. This plugin gives me the chance to sneak a peak at it while working. This plugin is dedicated to Albert Yarusso, a great friend and the biggest contributor to keeping the spirit of Atari alive. Without Albert I would not have met so many of the wonderful people I know today. 

== Updates ==

* Adjusted the overlapping publication date text for users of Internet Explorer.

To install the plugin just follow these simple steps:

1. Download the plugin and expand it.

3. Login into the WordPress administration area and go to the Plugins page.
4. Locate the "AtariAge Dashboard Feed" plugin and click on the activate link.
5. Visit the Dashboard > Widget page to add it to the WordPress Dashboard.
6. Plug in your wireless Atari joysticks, pull out the antenna and play some Chase The Chuckwagon, or Spiderfighter ( my favorite ).
