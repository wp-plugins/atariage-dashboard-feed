AtariAge Dashboard Feed

== Description ==

Based on the excellent plugin by Alberto Varela, this plugin has been modified to display the AtariAge RSS Feed directly on your WordPress Dashboard. Call it laziness, but I don't have time to check AtariAge as much as I would like and this gives me the chance to sneak a peak at it while working. This plugin is dedicated to Albert Yarusso, a great friend and the biggest contributor to keeping the spirit of Atari alive. Without Albert I would not have met so many of the wonderful people I know today. 

== Installation ==

To install the plugin just follow these simple steps:

1. Download the plugin and expand it.
2. Copy the 'AtariAge Dashboard Feed' folder into your plugins folder (wp-content/plugins/).
3. Login into the WordPress administration area and go to the Plugins page.
4. Locate the "AtariAge Dashboard Feed" plugin and click on the activate link.
5. Visit the Dashboard > Widget page to add it to the WordPress Dashboard.
6. Plug in your wireless Atari Joysticks, pull out the antenna and play some Chase The Chuckwagon.
